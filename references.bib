@misc{hettrick2014, title={UK Research Software Survey 2014}, DOI={10.5281/zenodo.14809}, abstractNote={<p>This spreadsheet contains the anonymised data collected as part of a survey of UK researchers in their use of research software.</p> <p>We asked people specifically about &ldquo;research software&rdquo; which we defined as:</p> <blockquote> <p>&ldquo;Software that is used to generate, process or analyse results that you intend to appear in a publication (either in a journal, conference paper, monograph, book or thesis).&nbsp;Research software can be anything from a few lines of code written by yourself, to a professionally developed software package.&nbsp;Software that does not generate, process or analyse results - such as word processing software, or the use of a web search - does not count as &lsquo;research software&rsquo; for the purposes of this survey.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> <p>We contacted 1,000 randomly selected researchers at each of 15 Russell Group universities. From the 15,000 invitations to complete the survey, we received 417 responses &ndash; a rate of 3% which is fairly normal for a blind survey.&nbsp;We used Google Forms to collect responses.</p> <p>The responses have good&nbsp;representation from across the disciplines, seniorities and genders. This is a statistically significant number of responses that can be used to represent&nbsp;the views of people in research-intensive universities in the UK.</p> <p>An overview of the data is available on the worksheet &quot;Summary data&quot;. Responses to questions are&nbsp;ordered by unique respondent ID. Please read the &quot;README&quot; worksheet for additional information about the collection and processing of this data.</p> <p>This survey&nbsp;data is licensed under a Creative Commons by Attribution licence.
