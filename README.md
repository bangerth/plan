## Instructions for editing the git book
To update chapters, edit the text for any of the `Rmd` files in the repository. The syntax is standard markdown. References are in Pandoc format (e.g. `[@ref-key]`). Copy your references to any new bib file (to avoid conflicts) and use this `yml` at the top of your chapter

```
---
bibliography: ["references.bib"]
biblio-style: "apalike"
link-citations: true
---
```

Replace `references.bib` with the name of your bib file.

### Building the book

GitHub actions will build the book. It takes ~4-10 minutes to build and you can see progress by clicking on the Actions tab and navigating to the current build.
